# UI Features Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the UI features of the Trending App, focusing on responsiveness, accessibility, and a theme toggle.

## Responsiveness

The application will be fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

-   **Mobile-First Approach:** The base styles will target mobile devices, and media queries will be used to add or adjust styles for larger screens.
-   **Flexible Layouts:** Use CSS Flexbox and Grid to create flexible and adaptive layouts.
-   **Fluid Typography and Spacing:** Use relative units like `rem` and `em` for font sizes, margins, and paddings to ensure they scale with the user's browser settings.
-   **Responsive Images:** Images will be responsive using `max-width: 100%` and the `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute where appropriate.

## Accessibility (a11y)

The application will be designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

-   **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.) to provide a meaningful structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements will be focusable and operable via the keyboard. A visible focus ring will be present for all focusable elements.
-   **Image Accessibility:** All images will have descriptive `alt` text.
-   **Color Contrast:** Ensure that text and background colors have sufficient contrast to be readable by users with low vision.
-   **Reduced Motion:** Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce animations for users who prefer it.
-   **ARIA Roles:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes where necessary to provide additional information to assistive technologies.

## Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode)

A theme toggle will allow users to switch between light and dark modes.

-   **CSS Custom Properties:** Colors, fonts, and other theme-related properties will be defined as CSS custom properties (variables).
-   **Theme Switching:** A button will toggle a class (e.g., `dark-theme`) on the `<html>` or `<body>` element. The CSS will use this class to apply the appropriate theme.
-   **Persistence:** The user's selected theme will be saved in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.
-   **System Preference:** On the first visit, the app will respect the user's system-level color scheme preference using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
